/**
 * Knowledge library — the structured "book of the firm" the Analyst
 * Builder/Editor/Manager agents consult when making decisions.

 * Three catalogs, one unified entry point:
 *   - strategy archetypes — trading styles with edge, risk, prompt skeletons
 *   - source catalog — vetted research sources with quality scores
 *   - signal type catalog — the taxonomy of signals the router speaks
 *
 * Each file is safe to import independently. This index re-exports the
 * high-traffic symbols and provides a `summarizeKnowledgeForPrompt()`
 * helper that turns the library into a compact system-prompt block.

  return `## Knowledge Library (summary)

You have access to a structured knowledge library of trading strategies,
research sources, and signal types. Use it to ground every config proposal.

### Strategy archetypes
${archetypes}

### Signal types
${signals}

### Premium sources (quality ≥ 4)
${topSources}

When you need the full entry for an archetype, source, or signal type,
call the \`read_knowledge_library\` tool. Do NOT invent archetypes,
signal IDs, or sources that are not in the catalog — they must match
these IDs exactly for the router and monitors to pick them up.`;
