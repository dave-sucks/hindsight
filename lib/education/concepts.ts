  analyst: {
    label: "Analyst",
    icon: Bot,
    tooltip: "An AI persona with its own strategy, watchlist, and trading rules that researches stocks and places paper trades autonomously.",
    description: "Analysts are AI personas you create through conversation. Each has a unique strategy document, sector focus, risk parameters, and watchlist. They run structured research sessions — reviewing holdings, discovering opportunities, and placing paper trades — then a separate briefing agent writes memory that carries forward to the next session.",
    explanation: "Think of analysts as autonomous research associates at a trading desk. You describe your trading style, and the AI builder creates a complete persona — strategy, rules, intelligence monitors, everything. Each analyst manages its own portfolio independently, runs daily at 8 AM, and gets smarter over time through a built-in memory system.",
  },
  thesis: {
    label: "Thesis",
    icon: Target,
    tooltip: "The analyst's verdict on a stock — LONG, SHORT, or PASS — with confidence, price targets, and reasoning.",
    description: "Every stock an analyst researches gets a thesis: a documented verdict (LONG, SHORT, or PASS) with a confidence score, entry/target/stop prices, bullet-point reasoning, and risk flags. Even stocks the analyst decides to pass on get recorded, so you can track whether passing was the right call.",
    explanation: "Theses are the core output of every research session. They're not just trade signals — they're full written analyses that explain why the analyst likes or doesn't like a stock, what the risks are, and exactly where it would enter and exit. PASS theses are just as important as trades — they let you measure whether the analyst is too conservative.",
  },
  signal: {
    label: "Finding",
    icon: Newspaper,
    tooltip: "A piece of market intelligence — news, earnings, macro event — gathered by background jobs and routed to relevant analysts.",
    description: "Findings are normalized pieces of market intelligence gathered by the overnight pipeline. Each has a headline, summary, affected tickers, sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral), urgency level, and source attribution. They're automatically routed to relevant analysts based on sector, watchlist, and theme overlap.",
  },
  monitor: {
    label: "Monitor",
    icon: Search,
    tooltip: "A search query or tracked website that the intelligence pipeline checks daily to gather findings.",
    description: "Monitors are the inputs to the intelligence pipeline. Search monitors are queries run via Perplexity Sonar every morning (e.g., 'semiconductor supply chain news'). Domain monitors track specific websites. The briefing agent can also create temporary dynamic monitors with expiration dates for time-sensitive topics.",
  },
  brief: {
    label: "Brief",
    icon: FileText,
    tooltip: "A structured summary — either a morning intelligence brief or a post-run standup memo — that feeds the analyst's next session.",
    description: "There are two types of briefs. Morning intelligence briefs are generated at 7:45 AM by GPT-4o from routed findings — they contain market context, portfolio alerts, watchlist updates, new opportunities, and risk flags. Post-run briefs are written by a separate briefing agent after each research session — they contain a narrative of what happened, strategy notes, watch-tomorrow items, and self-corrections.",
  },
  run: {
    label: "Run",
    icon: PlayCircle,
    tooltip: "A single research session where an analyst uses 14 tools to research stocks, form theses, and execute paper trades.",
    description: "A run is a structured research session following an 8-phase workflow. The analyst reads its morning intelligence, reviews holdings and watchlist, discovers new opportunities, synthesizes decisions, executes trades, and wraps up with a summary. Each run uses GPT-4.1 with 14 tools and a 30-step budget. Runs happen manually (you click Run) or automatically at 8 AM daily.",
  },
  trade: {
    label: "Trade",
    icon: ArrowLeftRight,
    tooltip: "A simulated buy or sell order executed on the Alpaca paper trading platform.",
    description: "Trades are paper orders executed through Alpaca's simulated brokerage. When an analyst has high enough confidence in a thesis, it places a market order. The system tracks entry price, target, stop-loss, and calculates real P&L as prices move. Trades are the measurable output that lets you evaluate whether an analyst's strategy actually works.",
  },
  position: {
    label: "Position",
    icon: ShoppingCart,
    tooltip: "An open paper trade being tracked — with entry price, target, stop-loss, and live P&L.",
    description: "A position is an active holding in an analyst's paper portfolio. Each tracks direction (long/short), entry price, shares, target price, stop-loss, and unrealized P&L updated from live prices. The analyst reviews all open positions at the start of every run and decides whether to hold, add, reduce, or exit.",
  },
  watchlist: {
    label: "Watchlist",
    icon: Eye,
    tooltip: "Stocks an analyst is monitoring but hasn't traded yet — prioritized with catalysts and target entries.",
    description: "The watchlist is an analyst's 'come back to this' list. Each item has a priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), upcoming catalyst, conviction level, and target entry price. High-priority items get reviewed first in every session. When an analyst trades a watchlist stock, it automatically graduates off the list.",
  },
  intelligence: {
    label: "Intelligence",
    icon: Radar,
    tooltip: "The background system that gathers market news, routes findings, and writes morning briefs before analysts run.",
    description: "The intelligence pipeline is five background jobs that run every weekday morning between 6:30–7:45 AM ET. They search the web, check tracked sources, monitor positions and watchlists, score and route findings to relevant analysts, and synthesize everything into personalized morning briefs. By 8 AM, each analyst has a curated inbox of intelligence — no scanning from scratch.",
    explanation: "Without the intelligence pipeline, each analyst would waste 3-5 tool calls every morning rediscovering the same news. The pipeline front-loads all that work overnight, so when analysts run at 8 AM they can skip straight to analysis and decision-making. It's the difference between an analyst who reads the morning paper before work and one who starts each day from zero.",
  },
  "learning-loop": {
    label: "Learning Loop",
    icon: RotateCcw,
    tooltip: "The memory system — a separate GPT-4o agent reviews each session and writes a standup that feeds the next run.",
    description: "After every research session, a separate briefing agent (GPT-4o) reads the full conversation transcript, portfolio state, and trade outcomes. It writes a structured standup: narrative, strategy notes, watch-tomorrow items, unresolved items, self-corrections, and dynamic monitors. This brief feeds into the next session's system prompt, creating run-to-run memory and accountability.",
  },
  pipeline: {
    label: "Pipeline",
    icon: Globe,
    tooltip: "The full daily cycle: intelligence gathering (6:30 AM) → analyst runs (8 AM) → briefing + memory (after each run).",
    description: "The complete Hindsight cycle runs daily: background intelligence jobs gather market data and route findings (6:30–7:45 AM), analysts run structured research sessions (8 AM), and post-run briefing agents write memory that feeds forward. The loop repeats every weekday, with each cycle building on the last.",
